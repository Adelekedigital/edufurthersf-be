    The token pattern is `[a-z0-9]+`, so any character outside it acts as a
    separator rather than being ignored. That fragments a name instead of
    merely altering it: "Koc" keyed as `ko`, "Boll" as `b|ll`, "Skodowska"
    as `sk|odowska`. A German or French award therefore had an identity key
    made of the pieces between its accents, and the same award reported
    without accents by another source never matched it.

    Decomposing and dropping the combining marks keeps the word whole.
    Measured over 1,808 live discoveries: 30 keys repaired, and - checked
    explicitly, because widening is the dangerous direction - zero
    previously distinct groups merged.
